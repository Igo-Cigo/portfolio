        Hello <br /> My name is Igor

        I'm currently a front-end / go / python developer interested in becoming a full time programmer in the future
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with web development at just 9 years old when I used random
        Website publishing services that nobody knows about.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dropped out of a python course because there was stuff we still didn't
        learn about in school. I'm currently 14 in 9th grade.
      </p>
      <p>My dream is to one day work in the front-end or do data science</p>
      <p>Find more information about me by using the bar at the top</p>
