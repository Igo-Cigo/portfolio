      <p>
        I was born and still live in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        My birth date is 2nd of February 2008.
        <br />I started making games in scratch and finished a course on it in
        5th grade.
        <br />
        My love for programming came from Github and seeing all Free and Open
        Source alternatives and that is why I always share every line of my code
        (except .gitignore ðŸ˜‰)
        <br />
        I can program in Python, Go and code in React and Svelte
        <br />
        Languages I can speak are: English,
        Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian/Montenegrin, and a bit of German
        <br />
        I've always been an advocate to make all software Free that's why I
        usually use alternatives to big industry products
        <br />
        Messing With hardware is something I like. I've installed atleast 20
        distros on my old ass laptop because setting it up just makes me happy.
        <br />
        Gaming is also my passion. When I come home from school I either play
        games or program or binge watch youtube.
        <br />
        Most of my projects are small. That's because I don't like to do one
        thing for a long time. Don't know if I have ADHD or that's normal.
        <br />
        If you'd like to support me you can click the PayPal icon at the
        navigation bar. I never sell any data, show ads, force a subscription,
        so that is the best way to support me.
        <br />
        In a contrast to loving tech, I may love nature even more. I don't
        travel a lot because I'm still a minor but when I grow up my goal is to
        get a lot of money from this job and travel the world.
